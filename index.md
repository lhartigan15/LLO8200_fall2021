## Data Science (LLO8200)
This is the course website for Professor Hartigan's sections of LLO 8200, Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and problem sets. Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected. I will upload updated files here when that happens. You should have R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package installed and updated prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing/updating R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf).

All files should be accessed from THIS page (not the LMS) to ensure you have the most up to date information. You are responsible for reviewing and ensuring you are following the schedule included in this semester's syllabus. The most up-to-date syllabus can always be found here and I will update the date when changes are made: [Hartigan's Spring 2022 LLO8200 Syllabus - 1/6/22](./Hartigan_LLO8200_syllabus_spring2022.pdf). 

If you want to set up email alerts for updates/additions to this site, you can use the free version of a third-party program: [Distill](https://distill.io/). The free version will check for updates every six hours and send you alerts. Note: this is a platform that is not owned by Vanderbilt or me and you should review their data privacy and security to ensure you are comfortable with their practices.

### Async/Sync RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the .Rmd files that you will use in tandem with the async videos each week. The leading number corresponds to the week of the semester; the LMS Mod number corresponds to the LMS Module number for asynchronous content. Note that, if no video link is provided for a given topic, you should watch the associated async video(s) on the LMS. The first file below (LMS Mod 0) is the file we use for our bootcamp meeting. The R Setup Slide Deck includes good information on R/Rstudio structure and some troubleshooting tips.

### Problem Sets
Each problem set should be uploaded to the LMS _before_ we meet for live session on the given due date. All submissions must include two files to receive credit:
1. .Rmd code file.
2. "Knit" file. The knit file can be in pdf or html (pdf is preferred). 

Note that you must upload BOTH files BEFORE you hit "submit" in the LMS; if you try to submit them one at a time, it will only allow you to upload one. Also, you are responsible for reviewing the files before uploading (check formatting, output, etc.). I will not accept submissions via email (unless there are extenuating circumstances). **There will be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.**

All problem sets are graded on a 100-point scale. Corrections can be submitted for any problem set and you can earn up to half of the deducted points back. You have one week from the time you receive feedback to submit corrections.

| File(s)      | Due Date          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Problem Set 1 .Rmd File](./01_ProblemSet_Mods1_4_7_starter.Rmd); [Problem Set 1 pdf](./01_ProblemSet_Mods1_4_7_starter.pdf) | 02/09/22 |

### Additional Resources
Because our syllabus differs slightly from what's in the LMS, the gradebook calculations won't be entirely accurate. If you'd like to keep track of your current average, here is a tool to help you do so. This properly weights the various course elements (note that you'll need to put in some "estimated" grades to populate an average). 
* [Data Science Average Calculator](./Student Average Calculator.xlsx)

"Common R Errors" doc: We've created a shared Box document and added everyone in this class as an editor. Please use this as a resource (and add to it when you figure out how to address an R error you've gotten). You can access it [HERE.](https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/4v3frpekn0p1k2tpv3r06xmyha5zce3h) (you will need to login with your Vandy email). 

The YAML header conundrum... When you download an .Rmd file from this site, the YAML header will be removed (for some reason). Here is a sample header that you can reference when adding the header at the top of your .Rmd file. Remember, your header MUST begin on line 1 of your .Rmd file and the formatting must stay consistent in order for it to work (e.g., must begin with three dashes and end with three dashes).

There are a multitude of resources re. RStudio and RMarkdown on the web. Here is where I'll save some of my favorites.
