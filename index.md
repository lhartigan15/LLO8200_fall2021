## Welcome to Data Science (LLO8200), Summer 2021

This is the course website for Professor Hartigan's sections of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and assignments. Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if youâ€™re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments are updated._) You should have R, RStudio, and Tidyverse installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Installing R and RStudio.pdf). Instructions for updating R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Updating R and RStudio.pdf).

While there are files on the "Files" section of the LMS, you should use the files from THIS page to ensure you have the most up to date information. Additionally, please reference this syllabus for information. You are responsible for reviewing and ensuring you are following the schedule included in this syllabus, found here: [Hartigan's Summer 2021 LLO8200 Syllabus](./Hartigan_LLO8200_syllabus_summer2021.pdf). 

### Async/Sync RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the async videos each week, listed by class week and LMS Module number.
* Week 1 - [LMS Mod1 - Introduction Rmd File](./01_Intro.Rmd), [College dataset](./college.Rdata)

### Known Corrections to Async Questions
* Week 1 - UNC Chapel Hill admit rate = 0.34

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets should be uploaded to the LMS _BEFORE_ we meet for live session on the given due date. All assignment submissions must include two files to receive credit:
1. .Rmd code file.
2. "Knit" assignment file. The knit file can be in pdf or html (pdf is preferred). 

Note that you must drag/drop (or upload) both files at the same time in order for the LMS to accept the submission; if you try to do them one at a time, it will only accept one. Also, you are responsible for reviewing the files before uploading. Be sure your submission is ready to upload before uploading; I will not accept submissions via email (unless there are extenuating circumstances). **There will be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.**

All assignments are graded on a 100-point scale. Corrections can be submitted for any assignment and you can earn up to half of the deducted points back. You have one week from the time you receive feedback on the assignment to submit corrections.

| File(s)      | Due Date          |

### Additional Resources
There are a multitude of resources re. RStudio and RMarkdown on the web. Here is where I'll save some of my favorites. 
* [R Markdown Reference Guide](./rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
* [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](./rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
